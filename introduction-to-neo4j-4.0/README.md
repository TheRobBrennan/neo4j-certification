# Introduction to Neo4j 4.0

[Introduction to Neo4j 4.0](https://neo4j.com/graphacademy/online-training/introduction-to-neo4j-40/) is a free two-day course.

## Lesson Overview

### Neo4j is a Graph Database

#### What is a graph?

The first use of graphs was by Leonhard Euler in 1735; he used graph theory to prove that the famous Seven Bridges of Konigsberg problem had no solution:

The Seven Bridges problem is this: Is there any possible route through the city that crosses every bridge exactly once?

Unlike other databases, relationships take first priority in graph databases. This means your application doesnâ€™t have to infer data connections using foreign keys or out-of-band processing, such as MapReduce.

#### Querying a graph is intuitive in Cypher

For example, in an organizational domain, here is what a SQL statement that lists the employees in the IT Department would look like:

```sql
SELECT name FROM Person
LEFT JOIN Person_Department
  ON Person.Id = Person_Department.PersonId
LEFT JOIN Department
  ON Department.Id = Person_Department.DepartmentId
WHERE Department.name = "IT Department"
```

In contrast, Cypher syntax stays clean and focused on domain concepts since queries are expressed visually:

```cypher
MATCH (p:Person)<-[:EMPLOYEE]-(d:Department)
WHERE d.name = "IT Department"
RETURN p.name
```

There are many uses for graph databases in an enterprise. Here are some of them:

#### Exploring graphgists

GraphGists are teaching tools which allow you to explore how data in a particular domain would be modeled as a graph and see some example queries of that graph data. Any developer can create a GraphGist by visiting [https://portal.graphgist.org](https://portal.graphgist.org).
